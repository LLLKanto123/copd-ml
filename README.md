We use modern techniques in data science to build a predictive model for the identification of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disorder (COPD) from clinical and laboratory data. COPD is a leading cause of deaths worldwide, esp. in highly urbanized regions. This is also one major concern during this pandemic because it could make one more likely to get severely ill from COVID-19 - see CDC advice here https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html
